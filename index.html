      <h1>The School Attendance Tracker of the Future</h1>
      <p>Data Harvest AS possesses innovative technology in the collection of attendance data among school students. Our foremost product is the intuitive, simple and universal machine-readable school absence document. This document makes the registration of absenteeism among school students, as well as the reasons for the absence, easier than ever, no matter where in the world your school is. Our main focus is areas and countries with low access to modern infrastructure, such as electricity and grid access. Therefore, this solution is both cheap in production and easy to operate.</p>

      <h2>The Problem</h2>
      <p>It is in important that children all over the world is attending school. We fear that many children will not return to school, especially now after this pandemic we all are experiencing. Furthermore, we do not have good enough data on why children are out of school and we do not use the data we have efficiently. In addition, the data we have do not reach someone that can do something about it.</p>

        <h2>The Technology</h2>
        <p>We have developed a machine that reads documents with registration of absence, and forwards it to a database. The point is that the documents are sent to central institutions. The local schools, which have low access to digital tools, fills in machine-readable documents. These documents are then forwarded to central institutions where they will be registered and entered in a central database.</p>
