      <h1>The Project</h1>
      <h2>What?</h2>
      <p>Data Harvest possesses innovative technology in the collection of attendance data among school students. Our foremost product is the intuitive, simple and universal machine-readable school absence document. This document makes the registration of absenteeism among school students, as well as the reasons for the absence, easier than ever, no matter where in the world your school is. Our main focus is areas and countries with low access to modern infrastructure, such as electricity and grid access. Therefore, this solution is both cheap in production and easy to operate.</p>
      <h2>How?</h2>
      <p>As the main focus for our solution, we chose areas and countries with low access to modern infrastructure such as electricity and grid access. We wanted to formulate a solution that is relatively cheap to operate and requires minimal training of teachers at the local level to be used. The solution must also be universal, ie that there must be no separate absence systems for schools with and without access to relevant infrastructure.
      <p>Our solution is a machine-readable absence document that is sent to a central database.</p>
      <p>Statistics that show a pattern of attendance and absence over time nationally, regionally or locally, will be able to help the administration to address the struggling students and adapt the curriculum for them. With few links between those who have the statistics, to the one who implements the measures themselves, to make the school day better. Reasons for absence must be registered, and can be done anonymously. Those who are absent can be sent a form, where the reason for absence is filled in if it takes place over a longer period of time.</p>

      <h2>Benefits</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Relatively simple technology</li>
        <li>Provides an overview of absences from several schools</li>
        <li>Achieves statistics that can map trends and the ability to identify regions with special challenges</li>
        <li>Organizations and local authorities will have the opportunity to create targeted measures against these groups</li>
        <li>A database is being created on why children are absent from school, about which Save the Children does not currently have enough knowledge</li>
        <li>Collects historical data - this also provides a good opportunity to see if the measures that are implemented have a real effect, as data will be submitted continuously</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Disadvantages</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>The documents must be transported physically (logistics, risk of loss)</li>
        <li>It can be difficult to obtain detailed information through machine-readable documents</li>
      </ul>
